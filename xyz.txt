Body: If the problem is so serious, are there some effective measures?
One possible way is that government could formulate legal minimum wage policy to guarantee that medical workers receive enough pay during normal working hours. The pressure caused by low income makes overtime work a must rather than a choice. Increase in regular wage may solve this problem, since it allows medical staff to choose whether they work overtime or not freely. Although there are some advantages in advocating such a practice, it may be not practical for relevant departments to carry out. You know, medical workers’ salary is always fixed at a low level and to change it requires financial support from the government budget. It’s not easy.
Besides, it is also recommended that government set up working time limit. Working time limit allows medical workers to work overtime in a reasonable way. Japan's bold trial to set 100 hours per month as overtime work since March 2019 have shown remarkable results. Chinese medical departments could follow the example of Japan and make appropriate adjustments according to national conditions. However, shortcomings of this method are also obvious: law enforcement and supervision are weak. Moreover, monitoring time is a burdensome work, making supervision more arduous, which is the obstacle Japan have met.
To tackle the issue at its root, universities could reform the medical education curriculum and make it more related to practice and appealing to students. The curriculum is suggested to be more focused on clinical science to enhance utility. In this aspect, Hong Kong gives a marvelous example. The University of Hong Kong designs a new medical curriculum which lays equal stress on the basic and clinical sciences. It proved to be practical and successful, giving an insight into the significance of reform. Even though the first method increases the wage of medical staff and second method sets some limit, medical staff still need to work overtime assuming that there are too many patients. The third solution seems perfect to some degree. But the disadvantage of this method had better not be overlooked, which is that the process may be a little bit long since reform is not easy to accomplish.
